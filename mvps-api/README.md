# MVPS API

This module contains the backend REST API for the MVPS application.

## Endpoint Usage Report

For a full list of HTTP endpoints and whether the `mvps-ui` frontend currently uses them, see:

- [mvps-api-endpoints.md](mvps-api-endpoints.md)

That report is generated from the OpenAPI specification and a scan of frontend calls, and is the best place to check before changing or removing an endpoint.
